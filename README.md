# courseraquakes

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

courseraquakes is the capstone project for coursera specialisation "Mastering R software development". 
This package load, clean up, and visualize National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) earthquake data.


## Installation

You can install the development version of courseraquakes like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("IBN0/courseraquakes")
```

## Data Cleaning

`initial_cleaning` gives you cleaned up date and location column. But it did not do further cleaning on other column, as the package does not interact with them.


```r
library(courseraquakes)
clean_df <- initial_cleaning()
clean_df %>% select(Location, Date, Magnitude, `Total Deaths`) %>% head()
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã— 4
#>   Location                 Date        Magnitude `Total Deaths`
#>   <chr>                    <date>          <dbl>          <dbl>
#> 1 Bab-A-Daraa,Al-Karak     -2150-01-01       7.3             NA
#> 2 Ugarit                   -2000-01-01      NA               NA
#> 3 W                        -2000-01-01       7.1              1
#> 4 Thera Island (Santorini) -1610-01-01      NA               NA
#> 5 Ariha (Jericho)          -1566-01-01      NA               NA
#> 6 Lacus Cimini             -1450-01-01      NA               NA
```

## Timeline Plot

For convenience, the package have wrapper function that filter the dataframe based on date and countries.


```r
timeline_plot <- timeline(clean_df, y = Country, minyear = 2010, maxyear = 2012, countries = c('INDONESIA', 'INDIA'))
plot(timeline_plot)
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="man/figures/README-timeline plot-1.png" alt="plot of chunk timeline plot" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk timeline plot</p>
</div>

If the label is turned on, then you can determine if you want to limit the amount of label shown based on n highest magnitude earthquake. 

<div class="figure">
<img src="man/figures/README-timeline with label-1.png" alt="plot of chunk timeline with label" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk timeline with label</p>
</div>
Notice how we define the `y` axis. If not defined, then all earthquake will coalescence into one line.

If you want to specify how you sort your data frame for label filtering/limiting, then you need to build your own ggplot2 data. 

<div class="figure">
<img src="man/figures/README-custom timeline-1.png" alt="plot of chunk custom timeline" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk custom timeline</p>
</div>

Keep in mind, if the column you select for label or magnitude have missing value, the geom will not report any warning.

## Interactive Map

The package also have wrapper for leaflet function. This will return interactive map. Just like `timeline` function, this function first filter the dataframe into filter function first


```r
map <- eq_map(df = clean_df, annotation = 'popup_text', minyear = 2001, maxyear = 2015, countries = c('CONGO', 'TANZANIA'))
```
The resulting image will look like this

While I write most of the code by myself, I adapted geomtimeline function from <https://github.com/RussellPolitzky/quake/tree/master>
